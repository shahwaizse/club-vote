This is the original ClubVote contract.  
The current MVP uses a much simpler version of this code, ommiting the concept of clubs entirely.  
This change was made solely because implementing the frontend for this contract involved quite a bit more screens than I originally expected.  
Including, but not limited to:  
-member approvals  
-rendering votes for specific clubs on search  
-screens for displaying information on votes of a club which are in-progress  
-and so many more.  
For a project who's main purpose was to teach me smart contract development + web3 frontend integration, the frontend part of the project was taking up way too much of the time I was spending writing code. I could have used tools like ChatGPT and Copilot to speed up the frontend development significantly, but one of the promises I held myself to while making this project was to ONLY use generative ai to understand fundamental concepts, and in no circumstance have generative ai WRITE the code I was going to use in my project.
