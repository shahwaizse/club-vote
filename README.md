## Usage/Examples

- you need the MetaMask wallet extension to use this app ðŸ¦Š
- grab some sepolia testnet tokens from google's [faucet](https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum/sepolia)
- you can view all the backend events for this app on [etherscan](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/)
- here's a vote ID for a vote which decides who the best member of the TMNT is: 
```js
49012122111194688057374043567767395038231870179919494587228416568323058161735
```

## Features

- you can't pay jamal from the app dev team to skew the votes so you can be president of the literature club instead of Monika
- decent UI (everything is yoinked from shadcn I have no original UI ideas)
- slow loading times due to my refusal to use an L2 (gives you time to make tea or coffee)
- ok I have to be honest there's not a lot of features

## Roadmap

- clubs functionality so one dude can't make 3000 metamask wallets and skew the votes (club head will have to approve people before they can vote)

- something like https://zkpass.org/ would allow clubs to automatically approve members becuase then each member would be verifiably unique, removing the need for manual approval.
